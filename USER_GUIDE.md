## FlashFantasy a gamified flashcard app 
A fantasy themed gamified flash card app that allows the user to create and study a deck, create quests (tasks) that can be marked as completed, 
and prompts the user to play one of two games or continue studying after the user finishes studying a flashcard deck. The flashcard system uses a 
spaced repetition algorithm to enhance learning. The purpose of the app is to help “gamify” the user's studying routine. With the occasional game being mixed in with the user's studying, 
studying becomes more fun. Through this system, players are given a chance to have a mental break and keep themselves engaged in their learning. The quests system allows the user 
to set study goals while making task completion fun. This app is particulary useful for people who struggle with ADHD.
Overall this app is designed to help users reach their study goals by making recalling information more enjoyable.  

## Installation/Setup  
Open github and navigate to the “FlashFantasy” repository 
Clone the main branch from the repository 
Activate the simulator to preview the code
Alternatively, the user may use Xcode and navigate to the “contentView” file and use the functionality of the app. 


## Usage 
Home Page:
The Home Screen of the FlashFantasy app serves as the main hub for creating, viewing, and managing flashcard decks. Designed with a fantasy-themed interface, the screen 
features a vibrant purple-to-blue gradient background and uses the “Papyrus” font to enhance the magical atmosphere. This screen is where users begin their flashcard journey,
offering a clear layout and intuitive tools for organizing study materials.


## Flashcards
The Flashcards is a system that allows the user to create/delete decks, while letting each deck contain cards with a question an answer. The user can start studying by selecting the 
deck which prompts a random card from the deck. The user may see the answer by clicking on the question. Afterwards, the user may click on the difficulty which prompts an SRS system 
that tells you how difficult the questions are and how long until you should study the card again. After the user is done with a deck, it will pop up an end screen congratulating the
user on finishing it.

## Tetris
A castle-themed tetris game. The user uses the left, right, and rotate buttons below the game field to navigate the tetriminos and the pause button to pause the game. 
When a line of blocks is created, the blocks are destroyed and the user’s score is incremented and dynamically updated on the top of the screen. There is a back button in the 
upper left corner that returns the user to the studyFlash card page. After the user’s tetrimons reach the top of the screen, the user is given a “game over,” message and is returned 
to the “play game page.” The option to play other games is grayed out, however, and the user must return to the study flash card page. 

## Flappy Bird/Flappy Dragon 
Flappy Dragon starts on a black screen. To start the game, simply tap the screen.
The goal of the game is to tap the screen to make the bird fly while avoiding the towers coming at you. You can collect coins to add to your score. If you hit a castle, then it is 
game over. You can exit the game by hitting the back button in the top-left corner.

## Settings
The settings page uses an interactive slider button to set how many flashcards you face before getting to the next minigame. This triggers the card number allowance to not exceed this 
and can be compared to the “difficulty”. If the user wants it to be harder to get the reward of the mini-game, they can increase the number of cards between plays or have the 
intermittent games be more frequent for more breaks. 

## Quests
By using a note-taking app style of progress keeping, the user is able to create their own challenges and mark when they believe they have completed them. This allows the user to
decide themselves if they are making adequate progress within their learning. Users are able to create quests, mark quest complete, insert a description, edit the quest, and 
delete them as needed.
