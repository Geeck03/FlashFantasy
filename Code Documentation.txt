Entry #1 (3/5/2025)

Features
	* Flappy dragon jumps when a touch is detected on screen.
	* Ground positioned correctly and visible.
	* Pipes show up and are randomized.
	* Pipes move at the dragon.

Bugs/room for improvement
	* Hitbox of dragon is inconsistent with other objects.
	* Pipes leave too much room in between and also spawn above the ground.
	* No death or game over yet.
	* Would like to add collectables.
